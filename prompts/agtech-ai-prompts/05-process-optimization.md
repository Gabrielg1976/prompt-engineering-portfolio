EXAMPLE:

Input:
```
Our cannabis processing team packages finished product for retail. Current process:
1. Weighing product (manually, one at a time)
2. Recording weight in spreadsheet
3. Filling containers
4. Labeling (printed labels, applied by hand)
5. Quality check
6. Moving to inventory shelves

Takes about 8 minutes per package. We do 200 packages per day. Staff complains about repetitive motion injuries. Labeling mistakes happen ~5% of the time requiring rework. We have 3 people on this task full-time.
```

Output:

## Process Overview
**Process Name:** Retail Product Packaging  
**Current State Summary:** Manual 6-step process averaging 8 minutes per package with 200 daily units  
**Key Stakeholders:** 3 packaging technicians, QC supervisor, inventory manager  
**Primary Pain Points:** Long cycle time, repetitive strain injuries, 5% labeling error rate, high labor intensity

## Current State Analysis

### Process Flow Breakdown

1. **Manual Weighing**
   - Time required: 2 minutes per unit
   - Resources needed: Digital scale, technician
   - Dependencies: Product available from previous department
   - Pain points: One-at-a-time process, manual data entry prone to error

2. **Data Entry (Weight Recording)**
   - Time required: 30 seconds per unit
   - Resources needed: Computer, spreadsheet
   - Dependencies: Weighing completed
   - Pain points: Double handling, transcription errors, spreadsheet becomes bottleneck

3. **Container Filling**
   - Time required: 1.5 minutes per unit
   - Resources needed: Containers, product, technician
   - Dependencies: Weight verified
   - Pain points: Manual handling, potential spillage

4. **Labeling**
   - Time required: 2 minutes per unit (print + apply)
   - Resources needed: Label printer, labels, technician
   - Dependencies: Container filled
   - Pain points: 5% error rate, reprinting waste, ergonomic strain from repetitive motion

5. **Quality Check**
   - Time required: 1.5 minutes per unit
   - Resources needed: QC checklist, technician
   - Dependencies: Package labeled
   - Pain points: Catches errors but doesn't prevent them, adds time

6. **Inventory Transfer**
   - Time required: 30 seconds per unit + batch movement time
   - Resources needed: Cart, technician, inventory system update
   - Dependencies: QC passed
   - Pain points: Batch movement inefficient, manual inventory update

### Metrics Assessment

| Metric | Current State | Industry Benchmark | Gap |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| Total cycle time | 8 min/unit | 4-5 min/unit | 60-100% slower |
| Labor hours | 24 person-hrs/day (3 FTE) | 12-16 person-hrs/day | 50-100% higher |
| Error rate | 5% | <1% | 400% higher |
| Cost per unit | ~$8 labor + materials | ~$4-5 | 60-100% higher |
| Throughput | 200 units/day | 300-400 units/day | 33-50% lower |

### Identified Inefficiencies

**Critical Issues (High Impact, High Priority)**

1. **Manual Weighing Bottleneck**
   - **Current Impact:** 2 min/unit √ó 200 units = 400 min/day = 6.7 labor hours
   - **Root Cause:** Sequential processing instead of batch processing; no automation
   - **Frequency:** Every single unit
   - **Affected Steps:** Steps 1-2 (weighing and recording)

2. **High Labeling Error Rate**
   - **Current Impact:** 5% √ó 200 units = 10 reworks/day √ó 4 min each = 40 min/day wasted + material waste
   - **Root Cause:** Manual label application prone to misalignment, wrong label selection, data entry errors
   - **Frequency:** ~10 times daily
   - **Affected Steps:** Step 4 (labeling), creates rework loop back to step 4

**Moderate Issues (Medium Impact)**

3. **Repetitive Motion Injuries**
   - **Current Impact:** Worker complaints, potential workers' comp claims, reduced productivity
   - **Root Cause:** Excessive manual handling (200+ repetitions per person per day)
   - **Frequency:** Continuous throughout shift
   - **Affected Steps:** Steps 1, 3, 4 (weighing, filling, labeling)

4. **Disconnected Data Systems**
   - **Current Impact:** Double entry (spreadsheet + inventory system), ~15 min/day on data reconciliation
   - **Root Cause:** Weight data not integrated with inventory management system
   - **Frequency:** Daily
   - **Affected Steps:** Steps 2 and 6 (data recording and inventory update)

**Minor Issues (Low Impact, Quick Fixes)**

5. **Inefficient Inventory Transfer**
   - **Current Impact:** Batch movement adds ~30 minutes/day
   - **Root Cause:** Packaging station location distant from inventory shelving
   - **Frequency:** 4-6 batch transfers per day
   - **Affected Steps:** Step 6 (inventory transfer)

## Bottleneck Analysis
- **Primary Bottleneck:** Manual weighing (Step 1-2)
- **Evidence:** Consumes 50% of total cycle time (4 of 8 minutes); sequential processing prevents parallelization
- **Impact:** Limits throughput to 200 units/day; if removed, capacity could increase 60-80%
- **Upstream Effects:** Product queues waiting for weighing
- **Downstream Effects:** Idle time in later steps when waiting for weighed product

## Waste Identification (Lean Principles)

- **Defects:** 5% labeling errors requiring rework (10 units/day)
- **Overproduction:** Not applicable
- **Waiting:** Idle time between weighing batches; waiting for QC approval
- **Non-utilized talent:** Skilled technicians doing repetitive manual tasks
- **Transportation:** Moving finished packages to inventory (30 min/day)
- **Inventory:** Not a major issue
- **Motion:** Excessive reaching, bending for 200+ units/day (injury risk)
- **Extra processing:** Manual data entry duplicated in two systems

- **Inventory Manager:** Real-time data availability (major positive), IT integration coordination (temporary effort)

**Communication Plan:**
- Week 1: Announce optimization project to all staff; emphasize goals (efficiency, injury reduction)
- Week 2: Present quick wins and timeline; gather feedback
- Monthly: Progress updates; celebrate wins
- Throughout: Transparency about FTE reduction (reassignment, not termination)

**Training Requirements:**
- Batch weighing process: 2 hours (all packaging staff) - Week 1
- New label templates: 1 hour (all packaging staff) - Week 1
- Automated equipment: 8 hours (all packaging staff) - Month 3
- Integrated data system: 4 hours (packaging staff + inventory team) - Month 3

**Resistance Mitigation:**
- **Fear of job loss:** Clearly communicate that 1 FTE reduction will be handled through attrition or reassignment
- **"We've always done it this way":** Involve staff in solution design; pilot new processes with champion employees
- **Technology anxiety:** Hands-on training; buddy system; celebrate early adopters

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Equipment delays | Medium | High | Order early; have backup vendor; maintain old process in parallel during transition |
