Moisture Content Tests (Target: 10-12%)
Batch 001: 11.2% - Pass
Batch 002: 13.5% - Fail
Batch 003: 11.8% - Pass
Batch 004: 13.1% - Fail
Batch 005: 10.5% - Pass
Batch 006: 12.9% - Borderline
Batch 007: 11.1% - Pass

Batch 002: 19.2% - Fail
Batch 003: 23.5% - Pass
Batch 004: 18.8% - Fail
Batch 005: 24.1% - Pass
Batch 006: 22.8% - Pass
Batch 007: 23.2% - Pass

Microbial Tests: All batches passed
Heavy Metals: All batches passed

Processing Room Temp: 68-72¬∞F (logged)
Humidity: 55-65% (logged)
```

Output:

## Executive Summary
**Overall Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERN - Immediate attention required

**Key Findings:**
- 28% failure rate this week (2 of 7 batches) - above acceptable threshold
- Both failures (Batch 002, 004) show correlated issues: high moisture + low potency
- Moisture content trending upward over past 3 batches
- Environmental controls within spec, suggesting drying process issue
- Microbial and heavy metal compliance maintained

**Critical Issue:** Batches 002 and 004 require disposition decision and root cause investigation

## Data Analysis

### Metrics Overview
| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status | Trend |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Pass Rate | 71% | >95% | ‚ùå | ‚Üì |
| Avg Moisture | 11.9% | 10-12% | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚Üë |
| Avg THC | 21.9% | 20-25% | ‚úÖ | ‚Üí |
| Microbial | 100% pass | 100% | ‚úÖ | ‚Üí |

### Pass/Fail Summary
- Total samples: 7 batches
- Passed: 5 batches (71%)
- Failed: 2 batches (29%)
- Borderline: 1 batch (Batch 006 moisture at upper limit)

## Issue Detection

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

**Priority 1 - Moisture Content Exceeding Limits**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Product safety and regulatory compliance
- **Affected batches:** 002, 004 (failed); 006 (borderline)
- **Root cause hypothesis:** Incomplete drying cycle OR environmental humidity spikes during drying
- **Recommended action:** 
  1. Quarantine failed batches immediately
  2. Inspect drying equipment (timers, airflow, temperature sensors)
  3. Review drying SOP compliance for these batches
  4. Check if Batch 006 needs retest before release

**Priority 1 - Correlated Potency Failures**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Revenue loss, customer satisfaction
- **Affected batches:** 002, 004 (same batches as moisture failures)
- **Root cause hypothesis:** High moisture may indicate premature harvest or improper cure, affecting cannabinoid development
- **Recommended action:**
  1. Review batch processing records for timing anomalies
  2. Check if different source material or growing conditions
  3. Consider if moisture affected potency test accuracy

### Warnings (Monitor Closely)

**Priority 2 - Upward Moisture Trend**
- **Current status:** Last 3 batches show increasing moisture (11.8%, 12.9%, 13.1% for batches with issues)
- **Trend:** Possible systematic process drift
- **Recommended action:**
  1. Increase testing frequency temporarily (every batch vs. sampling)
  2. Calibrate moisture meters
  3. Review environmental monitoring logs for humidity patterns

### Observations (For Improvement)

**Priority 3 - Batch 006 Borderline Performance**
- **Opportunity:** Proactive retest prevents future failure
- **Potential benefit:** Catch drift before it becomes failure
- **Recommended action:** Retest Batch 006 moisture before final release

## Trend Analysis

### Quality Trends
- **Moisture Content:** Concerning upward trend in past 3 batches (11.8% ‚Üí 12.9% ‚Üí 13.1% for concerning batches). This suggests systematic issue, not random variation.
- **Potency:** Stable overall (avg 21.9%) but failures correlate with moisture issues
- **Microbial/Heavy Metals:** Excellent compliance maintained

### Compliance Trends
- **Regulatory testing:** 71% pass rate below state requirement (typically 95%+)
- **Documentation:** Appears complete for passed batches
- **Failed batch disposition:** Requires immediate corrective action documentation

### Process Performance
- **Drying process:** Primary concern - investigate equipment and procedures
- **Testing accuracy:** Moisture meters may need calibration check
- **Environmental controls:** Within spec but monitor for spikes during drying

## Root Cause Analysis

**Issue:** Elevated moisture content in 2 batches

**Possible Causes:**
1. Drying equipment malfunction (timer, fan, dehumidifier)
2. Incomplete drying cycle (rushed or interrupted)
3. Environmental humidity spike during critical drying period
4. Source material had higher initial moisture
5. Moisture meter calibration drift

**Evidence:**
- Failures occurred in consecutive batch sequence (002, 004) suggesting time-related event
- Environmental logs show normal range (55-65% RH)
- Batches before and after show acceptable moisture

**Most Likely Cause:** Equipment issue or procedural deviation during Batches 002-004 processing window. The consecutive nature and correlation with potency suggests drying process interruption rather than random variation.

**Recommended Investigation:**
- Interview processing staff for any noted anomalies
- Check equipment maintenance logs
- Review batch processing times vs. standard
- Verify drying room conditions during that specific period

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)
1. **QUARANTINE** Batches 002 and 004 - prevent distribution (Owner: QC Manager)
2. **RETEST** Batch 006 moisture content before release (Owner: Lab Tech)
3. **INSPECT** all drying equipment - fans, timers, dehumidifiers (Owner: Facilities)
4. **DOCUMENT** corrective action report for regulatory compliance (Owner: Compliance Officer)

### Short-term Improvements (1-7 days)
1. **CALIBRATE** all moisture meters against certified standards (Expected impact: eliminate measurement error)
2. **REVIEW** drying SOPs with all processing staff (Expected impact: ensure procedural compliance)
3. **INCREASE** testing frequency to every batch until trend stabilizes (Expected impact: early detection)
4. **ANALYZE** source material quality and initial moisture of incoming batches (Expected impact: identify upstream issues)

### Long-term Strategies (ongoing)
1. **IMPLEMENT** real-time moisture monitoring during drying (continuous data vs. batch testing)
2. **ESTABLISH** early warning system for trending metrics approaching limits
3. **CONDUCT** quarterly equipment preventive maintenance review
4. **DEVELOP** process capability study to tighten control limits

## Compliance Assessment
- **Regulatory standards met:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNS - Two batches fail state requirements
- **Documentation complete:** ‚úÖ Testing records complete; corrective action documentation IN PROGRESS
- **Corrective actions required:** YES - Mandatory for failed batches under state regulations
- **Next audit readiness:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERN - High failure rate will trigger audit questions; have corrective action plan ready

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Corrective Action/Preventive Action (CAPA) report
- [ ] Root cause investigation summary
- [ ] Failed batch disposition (destroy/reprocess)
- [ ] Procedural changes implemented
- [ ] Retraining documentation

## Statistical Insights
- **Standard deviation (moisture):** 1.1% (elevated - target <0.8%)
- **Process capability:** Below acceptable (failures indicate Cpk <1.33)
- **Outliers detected:** Batches 002, 004 are 2+ standard deviations above mean
- **Control limits:** Process showing signs of being out of statistical control

**Interpretation:** Process variation exceeding normal range suggests assignable cause (equipment/procedure) rather than random variation.

## Follow-up Requirements
- [x] Retest specific batches (006)
- [x] Update procedures (review drying SOP)
- [x] Additional training needed (drying process staff)
- [x] Equipment calibration check (moisture meters + drying equipment)
- [ ] Supplier quality review (check incoming material if issues persist)
