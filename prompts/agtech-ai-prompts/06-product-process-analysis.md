Usage Case: to analyze  the time costs and profitablity of diffrent methods of process the product this is algined to 
compare Machine Trimming , Hand trimmer or a Hybrid Varition. 

**PROMPT:**
Role:
“You are a  professional processing analyst,

“Your goal is to analyze The following 3 methods and provide a clear, actionable breakdown that improves understanding and decision-making.”

Context:
“Here’s the situation/background you should consider:

[Insert brief summary of the problem, data, or goal — e.g., declining sales, workflow inefficiency, content performance metrics, etc.]”

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Senerio:

We are currently testing 3 different methods of processing the finished product currently

**Test Stats** 

 128 Plants for each strain

 Strain 1: "Apple Slapz" Machine Trimmed Method 
 
 Finished Buds = 5180 grams
 med=3678
 minis=1502
 OM: 2720 
 
 Strain 2: " Red Bullz" Hand Trimmers Only Method 
 
 finished Buds total= 6740 grams
 MED=4733 grams
 Mini=2007 grams
 OM=3527 grams

 Strain 3 "Strain Name "
 
 Finished Buds total= 
 MED = 4733 grams
 Mini = 2007 grams
 OM =  grams

**method 1 = Machine Trim**

 Each step requires the following hours to complete
 Bucking of product  2 empolyees working 4hrs of labor 
 Machine run 1 employee for 8 hrs
 Machine clean
 Sifting

**method 2  =  hand trimmer only**
 
 Tray prep 1 person 1 hour total
 Hand trimmers total of 5 employees working total of  19.5 hrs
 Sifting Time 1 person total of 2 hours

**Method 3: Machine/Hand Hybrid**

This method is combination of the two above methods where the large buds are hand trimmed and small buds are machine trimmed.

The labor stats
Tray prep time: 1 person x 1 hour of labor
Trimmers Time: 6 people x 5 hours of labor
Machine Trim time: ( ran at 6 minute batches)
Machine clean time: 1 person x  1 hourof labor

The output is 3 variotions of final products
Med values equals $1.77 gram 
Mini 
OM value equals $0.50 gram
