## 🌱 My Unique Approach: Agriculture Meets AI

With 20+ years in agricultural operations and quality control, I bring a unique perspective to prompt engineering:

- **Domain Expertise:** Deep understanding of agriculture, horticulture, and biotech
- **Quality Control Mindset:** Systematic testing and validation from regulated industry experience
- **Process Optimization:** Proven track record of improving complex workflows
- **Documentation Excellence:** Experience creating clear SOPs and technical documentation

This combination allows me to create prompts that are not only technically sound but also practical and industry-specific.
